SQLite and Python used to create a CLI program to search for data about PC games and PC game developers. 

## Instructions for testing

1. Simple Query A: Enter linux, windows, or mac and the word "game"

    EXAMPLE 1:
    - linux game
    
    EXAMPLE 2:
    - windows game
    
2. Simple Query B: Enter a field, table, and a game or developer name for a simple query when prompted 

    EXAMPLE 1: 
    - developer game undertale

    EXAMPLE 2: 
    - country developer tobyfox
    
3. Advanced Query: Enter a field, game, name1, developer, name2, for an advanced query when prompted. You must specify a foreign key 
in the other corresponding table when prompted. The correctness of the advanced query can be verified through 
entering the following three commands subsequently: 

    EXAMPLE:
    - release game terraria
    - release game terraria developer re-logic
    - release game terraria developer techland

NOTE: The Terraria record for Techland has been created solely for the purpose of displaying the advanced query functionality.
